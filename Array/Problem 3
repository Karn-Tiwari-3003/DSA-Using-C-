/*
In a far distant world, there is a hero named Saitama and with just one punch he can paralyze his enemies for a certain period.
Saitama is fighting Garou and is hitting him at certain points in time represented by a sorted array. After each punch, Garou is
paralyzed for a certain duration of time represented by an integer. Your task is to find the total duration of time Garou will be in a 
paralyzed state. 

Input format
First line contains test case T.T test cases follow,
First line contains N representing the total number of time Saitama punch Garou and an integer k representing the paralyzes duration after each punch.
Second line contains a sorted array representing the times at which Saitama punches Garou.

Output format
For each test case, print the total duration of time Garou will be in a paralyzed state.

Constraints
1<=T<=10
1<=N<=10^6
1<=A[i]<=10^5
1<=k<=10^7
