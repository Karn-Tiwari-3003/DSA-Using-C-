/*
Let's start with a simple problem.
You are given a number N, and the task is to find the sum of all numbers from 1 to N. PrepBuddy knowns that using loops you can solve it, he asks you to solve it using recursion.

Input format
First line contains Test case variable T.Each of the next T lines contains an integer N.

Output format
For each test case print the sum of all numbers from 1 to N (inclusive).

Constraints
1 <= N <= 1000

  if(n == 0)

  while(t--){
    int n;
